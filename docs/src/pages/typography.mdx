import FamilyTable from '../components/Typography/FamilyTable.tsx';
import TypeScales from '../components/Typography/TypeScales.tsx';

We provide CSS classes for font family, weight and size.

In the latest release, if you are **not** importing the global stylesheet, you can import the typography style using the following:

```js
import '@wevisdemo/ui/styles/typography.css';
```

## Family/Weight

<FamilyTable client:idle />

## Typescales

Heading and body size will scale down on mobile. However, UI size will be the same on both mobile and desktop.

<TypeScales client:idle />
