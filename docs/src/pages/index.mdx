This project aim to help any developer kick start a new WeVis project with ease. The design systems are co-develop with the designers, making consistancy between the library and Figma design.

[View source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wevisdemo/design-systems)

## 1. Install the package

with **NPM**

```shell
npm i @wevisdemo/ui
```

or with **Yarn**

```shell
yarn add @wevisdemo/ui
```

## 2. Import the stylesheet

Import `@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css` as a global according to your framework.

For example, with **NuxtJS**

```js
// nuxt.config.js
{
  css: ['@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css'],
}
```

Most framework can be imported to main JavaScript or template file directly

```js
import '@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css';
```

## 3. Use the components

Components are available for **Vue2**, **React**, and **Svelte** which separated in package sub-directoy. Recommends to import with `Wv` name prefix to avoid duplicated component name. For example:

```jsx
import WvButton from '@wevisdemo/ui/{react,vue2,svelte}/button';

<WvButton>Hello</WvButton>;
```

## NOTES

### Vue 2

According to [Mitosis bug with Vue props type](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/847), no declaration files in the package until the bug is solve. Use `/* @ts-ignore */` over import statement in Typescript project.

```ts
/* @ts-ignore */
import WvNavbar from '@wevisdemo/ui/vue2/navbar';
```

### Nuxt 2

Nuxt 2 don't support ESModule out of the box. Need to add the library into `build.transpile` in `nuxt.config.js`

```js
// nuxt.config.js
build: {
  transpile: ['@wevisdemo/ui/vue2'],
}
```

### Svelte

Mitosis has [issue generating optional props for Svelte](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/913) Optional string props now use `''` as a default for a workaround. But `function` props are still have problem. Please provide empty function `() => {}` until futher updates.

```svelte
<WvButton onClick={() => {}} />
```
