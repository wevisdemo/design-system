## 1. Install the package

with **NPM**

```shell
npm i @wevisdemo/ui
```

or with **Yarn**

```sh
yarn add @wevisdemo/ui
```

## 2. Import the stylesheets

### 2.1 Single global stylesheet

You can import all component style by importing `@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css` as a global according to your framework.

For example, with **Nuxt.js**:

```js
// nuxt.config.js
{
  css: ['@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css'],
}
```

Most framework can be imported to main JavaScript or template file directly:

```js
import '@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css';
```

### 2.2 Typography + per-component stylesheets

To minimized build output, you can also import typography and individual component style:

- Import `@wevisdemo/ui/styles/typography.css` instead of `index.css` as shown in step 2.1.
- Import per component `@wevisdemo/ui/styles/<component-name>.css` as shown in step 3.

## 3. Use the components

Components are available for **Vue 3**, **React**, and **Svelte** which separated in package subdirectory. Recommends to import with `Wv` name prefix to avoid duplicated component name. For example:

```jsx
import '@wevisdemo/ui/styles/button.css';
import WvButton from '@wevisdemo/ui/{react,vue,svelte}/button';

<WvButton>Hello</WvButton>;
```
