This project aim to help any developer kick start a new WeVis project with ease. The design systems are co-develop with the designers, making consistancy between the library and Figma design.

## 1. Install the package

with **NPM**

```shell
npm i @wevisdemo/ui
```

or with **Yarn**

```shell
yarn add @wevisdemo/ui
```

## 2. Import the stylesheet

In the latest release, you can import individual component style from `@wevisdemo/ui/styles/<component-name>.css` as shown in step 3.

You can also import all component style by importing `@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css` as a global according to your framework.

For example, with **Nuxt.js**:

```js
// nuxt.config.js
{
  css: ['@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css'],
}
```

Most framework can be imported to main JavaScript or template file directly:

```js
import '@wevisdemo/ui/styles/index.css';
```

## 3. Use the components

Components are available for **Vue 3**, **React**, and **Svelte** which separated in package sub-directoy. Recommends to import with `Wv` name prefix to avoid duplicated component name. For example:

```jsx
import '@wevisdemo/ui/styles/button.css';
import WvButton from '@wevisdemo/ui/{react,vue,svelte}/button';

<WvButton>Hello</WvButton>
```

## Notes

### Vue 3

According to [Mitosis bug with Vue props type](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/847), no declaration files in the package until the bug is solve. Use `/* @ts-ignore */` over import statement in Typescript project.

```ts
/* @ts-ignore */
import WvNavbar from '@wevisdemo/ui/vue/navbar';
```

### Svelte

Mitosis has [issue generating optional props for Svelte](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/913) Optional string props now use `''` as a default for a workaround. But `function` props are still have problem. Please provide empty function `() => {}` until futher updates.

```svelte
<WvButton onClick={() => {}} />
```
